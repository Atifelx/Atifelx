# 👋 Hi, I’m Atif Shaikh

Forward Deployed Engineer / Senior Product Engineer focused on building and operating **production AI SaaS** for real customers.

I work at the intersection of **engineering, product, and customer deployment** — translating messy business problems into reliable systems that ship, scale, and stay up.

## 🧠 What I Do

- Build **GenAI-powered SaaS applications** (chat, content, analytics, automation)

- Embed with customers to understand real workflows and unblock adoption
- Ship pragmatic solutions with a focus on **reliability, cost, and outcomes**
- Debug production issues when things break — not just demos
